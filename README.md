# Masters-thesis
The code used for my Master's thesis, KTH 2023/2024. 

`main.ipynb`  contains the main file for querying the database of records and generating proper CSV files for the ML models to train on. The other files are the ML classifiers used in the thesis; Random Forest, SVM, Naive-Bayes, and Multi-layer Perceptron (an ANN).
